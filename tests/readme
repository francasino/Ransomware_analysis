This folder contains a set of scripts and python files that are used to compute all the statistical tests. 

Note that this scripts are just a guideline to compute and use the different features possible given the original binaries. Therefore, we assume that you have a local copy of the sp800 binaries as well as other sources.

The files are tuned to skip most of the statistical tests, so use them as an auxiliary tool and modify them accordingly.

For the sake of clarity, we assume in the Jupiter Notebook file of the main project that we have already computed the tests and obtained a summary of outcomes.
